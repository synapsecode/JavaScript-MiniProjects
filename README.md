# JavaScript-MiniProjects (Instagram: @synapse.code)
 A Repository for all the small Javascript miniprojects ive built during my take on the 100daysofcode challenge.
 Since I do not have a lot of time to commit to big projects i have decided to make numerous smaller mini projects to strengthen my grip on the JavaScript language.
